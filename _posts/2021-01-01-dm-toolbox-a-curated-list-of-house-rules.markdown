Here is a list of interesting houserules that I have found. They are not collected with the goal of amending allegedly "unbalanced" RAW rulings, but to give you some new mechanical tools that would make your game faster or set the tone for new fun and dramatic RP moments. 

This list is going to get expanded as new ideas come to mind or the hivemind of role-players in the internet spawns something eye-catching. Terminology used is regarding DnD 5e, but feel free to use your imagination to adapt them to your favourite system.

# Game speed up


<div class='descriptive'>
<h5>Matt Mercers' potion speed</h5>
During combat, taking a potion takes a bonus action and feeding a potion someone unconscious is one action
</div>

<div class='descriptive'>
<h5>Matt Colville's 3D distance calculation</h5>
Calculating ranges between two 3D points on different levels of height (water, aerial, any environment where something can be above or below you) is the greater number of the forward or vertical distances. 
</div>

{:refdef}
In this case, I would consider the Sahuagin being at 30ft as the horizontal distance is greater than the vertical (15 ft.) even though the real distance is ≈33.54 ft. 



# Pure fun

<div class='descriptive'>
<h5>Critical failure (1)</h5>
Critical failure on skill checks. 
</div>

<div class='descriptive'>
<h5>Critical failure (2)</h5>
<em style="color:grey;">You need to use "Critical failure (1)"</em><br>
Rolls for acquiring any knowledge (History, Arcana, Perception, Religion, etc.) are done by the DM, behind the screen. 
<br>

<br>
<em>Allows for giving malicious information that can lead to dramatic/funny moments. Make sure you're good with your group before implementing this.</em>
</div>

<div class='descriptive'>
<h5>Critical failure (3)</h5>
If a player critical fails on an attack, ask another player to choose what the fumble outcome is.
</div>
 
<div class='descriptive'>
<h5>Action: Assassination</h5>
<strong>Strength check (DC dependent on the toughness of the foe)</strong> to instantly kill enemies that are same size or smaller which cannot defend in any way (sleeping deeply, unconscious, paralized).
</div>

<div class='descriptive'>
<h5>Advantage critical</h5>
Rolling the same number twice when rolling with advantage is considered a critical success. Rolling double ones is still  critical failure.
</div>
